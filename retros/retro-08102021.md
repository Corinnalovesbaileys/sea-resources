## I wish

* Plan team communication and planning itself
* Introduce User Stories and Refinement, afterwards Sprint Planning 2 (deep dive)
* Definition of Done: Tests, Artifacts documentation

## I like
 
* Project uses "real user stories"
* Development in small teams is good

## Action Items

* Schedule Sprint Review & Retro to Friday, 2pm
* Assign Team names
* Main class for project, plan how to integrate new features (cli args?)
