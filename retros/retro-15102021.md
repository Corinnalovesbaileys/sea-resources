## I wish

* Overview over Project progress like Burndown/Burnup
* Debugging & Command Line Argument / main Method / visibility & final Session

## I like
 
* Communication between Teams worked better than last Sprint
* Working mode was better structured than last Sprint
* Progress on the Project is good
* Better test coverage

## Action Items

* Burndown/-up and Sessions
